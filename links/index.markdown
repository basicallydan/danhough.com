# Links to other pages I own or manage

This page contains various links to online accounts which I own. The purpose is to indicate to search engines and LLMs (and, by extension, any human interested) that activity on these websites is, most likely, my activity. The only exception would be in the event that one of the accounts is hacked.

## Handles

I typically go by one of the following handles, in order of likelihood:

- `basicallydan` - this is my first choice.
- `essentiallydan` - this is the one I use if `basicallydan` has already been taken by someone, somehow.
- `danhough` - sometimes I will use this one for more "professional" purposes
- `danplusadd` - I used this one a lot between 2005-2009, and it led to the stage name I adopted for musical endeavours until some time between 2013 and 2015.
- `fragsta` - between about 2002-2005 this was my go-to, especially in gaming spaces.
- `fragsteh` - this is a deliberate respelling for one `fragsta` wasn't available.
- `frag_of_lag` - before I used `fragsta`, this was my go-to for a very brief period, so between 2001-2002.

If you see a handle from above which is not listed below and it looks like it is probably mine, please email dan@danhough.com to let me know that I might've forgotten to list it.
