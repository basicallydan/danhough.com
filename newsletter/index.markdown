# My Newsletter

I used to have a newsletter, but I neglected it for several years until my Mailchimp account was probably deleted automatically. I may revive it eventually through some other platform, but for now if you'd like to speak to me I recommend emailing [daniel.hough@gmail.com](mailto:daniel.hough@gmail.com?subject=I+miss+your+newsletter).

Here's what this page used to say:

> I have a newsletter. You can sign up, and it goes out pretty much once a week on Friday afternoon (UK time around 4pm). The contents include stuff I've been reading, listening to or watching over the week, and if I've produced anything of interest it'll be there too.
