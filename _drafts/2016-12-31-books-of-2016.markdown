## [Burmese Days](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003FXCSRM) by George Orwell

I read this book right after I got back from my [six month trip through Asia](/travel), since my interest in colonialism had been piqued by my trip. It's sad, but an important perspective on the terrible ways that the British treated their "subjects" in that era. Semi-autobiographical.

## Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits by David Wong

This was quite a slog, as it were. I'm not sure that David Wong's style really works for me.

## The Invisible Man by H.G. Wells

## The Island Of Doctor Moreau by H.G. Wells

## One's Company by Peter Fleming

I read this during a trip to Russia, and I can tell you that reading a book which features a train journey in a country you're also taking a train journey in, 80 years later, is a doubly fascinating experience.

## The Colour Of Magic

## HERLAND

## The Home DIY Expert (ongoing)

## A Room Of One's Own

## A History of the World (ongoing)
