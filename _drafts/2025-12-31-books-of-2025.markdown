## Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe

Finished: April 2025

As a new arrival in Australia, Pascoe offered me soem wonderful insights and myth-busting revelations which have helped me to understand a little about the extremely-long-lived Aboriginal cultures which preceeded Europeans and continue to exist alongside the culture which dominates the common vision of Australia today. Pascoe explains this in detail, sometimes passionately but never condescendingly, knowing full well that the reader probably has had quite a poor education on pre-colonial Australian society. Highly recommended, read with an open and curious mind.

## Wicked by Gregory Maguire

Finished: May 2025

Having read it many many years ago, I thought I'd remember more. However I think because I've seen and listened to the musical so many times, and seen and listened to the first film so many times, I forgot how different Wicked the novel is from its eventual stage and film adaptation. I don't know if I think it's as weird as the reputation it has suggests, but it is a bit odd and strangely written in parts. I see what Maguire is trying to do in terms of explaining The Witch, but it feels a little rushed and unbelievable at times. Nonetheless, good fun and quite gripping.

## The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley

Finished: June 2025

What I thought would be a gripping sci-fi romp full of conspiracies and dystopias was a lot more light-hearted. More akin to a historical fiction romance, it was a lot of fun, and still did pack a decent punch in terms of sci-fi thriller intrigue.
