Just had an amazing idea

[11:56]  
For a single line of dialogue in a film

[11:56]  
Where like, there's this wedding scene

[11:56]  
And the people gettign married are gangsters or somethin, and everybody at the wedding has a gun

[11:57]  
Because it's like two gangsters getting married from different gangs

[11:57]  
Kinda like a modern romeo and juliet

[11:57]  
And the priest is like

[11:57]  
"Y'all are gathered here today" etc

[11:57]  
And they're like "If you see any reason why these two bangers shouldn't be wed in the holiest of matrimonies"

[11:58]  
"Speak now or forever hold yo' _piece_"

[11:58]  
And the camera then focuses on people thumbing the hammers of their pistols

[11:58]  
And theres like all this tension in the room

Sean Preston [11:58 AM] 
excellent

[11:58]  
you will make a good director (edited)

Dan Hough [11:58 AM] 
Thanks

Sean Preston [11:58 AM]

Dan Hough [11:58 AM] 
We need to come up with an entire feature-length movie for this

Sean Preston [11:58 AM]

[11:59]  
Just for this one scene
