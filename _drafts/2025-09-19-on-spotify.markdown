I recently made the decision to end my Spotify Premium subscription.

There are plenty of popular criticisms of Spotify out there: They Don't Pay Artists Fairly, They Platform Dangerous Podcasters, Their CEO Invested Money In An AI-Powered Weapons Drone.

All of those are valid crticisms which I would gladly agree with, and to varying degrees they are important. None of them, though, are the single reason I ditched Spotify.

My reasoning for abandoning my Spotify Premium account was, in my opinion, more fundamental than any of those. To summarise, I think Spotify's effective monopoly over Music Platforming is a net negative for humanity's relationship with music, and I feel like I'm wasting my money.

## This Is the Last Time

I learned recently that Spotify has employed some Large Language Model-based, so-called AI tools, under the name [The Velvet Sundown](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/14/an-ai-generated-band-got-1m-plays-on-spotify-now-music-insiders-say-listeners-should-be-warned).

This move alone isn't my reason for ditching Spotify. In fact, it's not necessarily a big deal. Maybe this is a one-time thing, or a joke, or a proof-of-concept. At best, it could be a demonstration of how easy it is to masquerade as a human musical artist, in order to warn listeners to think critically about what they're listening to.

But unlike with people, when it comes to businesses, especially large nad monopolistic ones, I do not give the benefit of the doubt. I will probably assume that the move was motivated by greed.

## That Funny Feeling

For the longest time, perhaps even since the beginning of Spotify, I've accepted but not been fully comfortable with the fact that I'm renting music from Spotify, and I am able to enjoy the music they stream to me at _their_ pleasure.

In the beginning, I viewed Spotify as an enthusiastic, music-loving entity which intended to end music piracy and create a fairer system for artists. The convenience and relatively low price was worth it for many people who were used to simply downloading an album or a single MP3 from a filesharing website or peer-to-peer network.

It was exciting. A huge, huge catalogue of music. So many new artists to discover, which I'd heard about but never felt compelled to look up.

### A non-exhaustive list of pre-Spotify artists I got Very Into through using Spotify

- Everything Everything
- The Beths
- Tears for Fears
- Billy Joel
- The Beatles
- Supertramp
- Phoebe Bridgers

## Somebody That I Used to Know

So how did I used to listen to music before I had Spotify?

Back in 2009, when Spotify first entered my life, I had an MP3 player.

## Writing notes

Originally, I wrote titles for each section based on idioms or stories such as "The Straw That Broke The Camel's Back" and "The Pea Beneath The Mattress". As I started writing about how I used to listen to music pre-Spotify, though, I wrote "Somebody That I Used to Know" then had the idea to use song titles for all section headers. In case you're interested, they are:

- This Is the Last Time by Keane
- That Funny Feeling by Bo Burnham
- Somebody That I Used to Know by Gotye

I'm sure your Google-fu is still sufficiently honed in this Age of AI to find streams, videos or downloads of these tracks online. ðŸ˜‰

{% capture why_content %}
I wanted to document my personal reasoning for leaving Spotify, not because I think my opinion matters more than anyone else's, but because I wanted to more-clearly express and understand my opinion.

It's an exercise in critical thinking; forcing myself to articulate why I'm making this choice rather than just going with the flow. 

For the curious, I this provides a less-common perspective and might even help someone else to rethink their own perspective.

Finally, I wanted to document my thought process while it's still fresh, before I forget the specific frustrations that led to this decision.
