It's the 28th of May 2008. Much of the world is coming to terms with the 2007 Mortgage Crisis, and _Northern Rock_ has recently been nationalised. Dmitry Medvedev has recently become the Russian President and Barack Obama will be elected as President of the USA. SpaceX is a few months away from launching the first privately developed space launch vehicle to reach orbit, the Falcon One.

Up in Sheffield, I am a few months into the first year of my Computer Science degree, and down in London my buddy Roo, long before we knew each other, has just written a piece on his blog titled [_Welcome to the New Sincerity_](https://rooreynolds.com/2008/05/28/welcome-to-the-new-sincerity/).

Eight years later, I've decided to comment on it. The point I'm going to focus on in this post is Roo's subscription to _New Sincerity_, which refers to the breaking away from concepts like postmodernist irony and cynicism. Roo is an infinitely enthusiastic man, and is never shy about sharing, sincerely, his feelings or opinions, as long as they are welcome. This came up in a conversation on Twitter.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/basicallydan">@basicallydan</a> that! It&#39;s one of the reasons I&#39;m usually (overly and annoyingly) sincere.</p>&mdash; Roo Reynolds (@rooreynolds) <a href="https://twitter.com/rooreynolds/status/800744126505328640">November 21, 2016</a></blockquote>

Roo shared with me his blog post from 2008, in which he suggests the following:

> I can’t help think that whatever comes – and has been coming – after postmodernism is going to have to be not just participatory but also a lot more positive than what Kirby is describing.

I love this idea. I wish I'd seen this years ago. I think the New Sincerity fits with my current worldview pretty well, but I think I could go further. I'm not unashamedly sincere in everything I do. Maybe most things, but not everything. I play down some parts of my personality and interests hidden or under wraps from certain people, because I don't want to seem completely ridiculous. I don't lie about my interests or quash parts of my personality to most people, I'm generally pretty sincere. But I could do better.
