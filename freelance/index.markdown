# Full-stack Software Engineer

I've been a professional developer since 2010, with experience ranging from early-stage startups to established companies. In that time I've worked with great companies like Beam, Jungle Scout, Marvel, and Huddle, building impactful products and leading technical teams. I specialize in AI integration, web applications, and infrastructure, with a strong focus on product intuition and pragmatic solutions.

## Developer for Hire

Currently, I'm settling into my life in Melbourne, Victoria. While I'm not actively seeking work right now, I'm always interested in hearing about interesting opportunities, particularly for contract or freelance roles. If you need an experienced engineer to help build your product or lead your team, **I'm your person**. With 15 years of experience in startups and product development, I particularly excel at:

- Ruby on Rails and JavaScript development (7+ and 15+ years respectively)
- AWS cloud architecture and infrastructure
- Integrating Large Language Models and AI tools into existing products
- Technical leadership and system architecture
- Cross-team collaboration and mentorship

I also have extensive experience with modern web technologies, databases, and development practices. Here's a couple of things that people have said about me over the years:

<blockquote>
First up, Dan is great fun to work with and he has masses of enthusiasm about pretty much anything.  He is knowledgeable about a great deal of web software development, both client side and server side, and also had great input into user experience and usability design of the app he built for us.

</blockquote>

I'm open to all sorts of offers. For me, being a developer is about working on **lots of interesting projects**, meeting **great people** and getting **experience** in many fields and technologies. Whatever your situation, budget or goals, get in touch and let's see if we can work something out.

<blockquote>
<p>I worked with Dan for 18 months at Beam - we were the 2 colocated devs in a dev team of 3, so worked very closely together for a long period!</p>
<p>Dan is an exceptional full stack developer. He’s got a constant desire to learn and do things in the best way. He’s interested in the cutting edge, and also pragmatic. He writes clean code and follows best practices and cares deeply about readability, usability, performance, and scale. He also contributes heavily to product and design, takes feedback well, and gives generous and helpful code review.</p>
<p>Beyond this he’s a top human - kind, funny, gregarious and has the fortitude to go the distance. Highly recommended! ✅</p>

<blockquote>
Dan was a great addition to our team when we needed him most: in the run up to our iOS app launch. He settled in extremely quickly and got on well with the rest of the team. His work was exceptional and he required little management. We couldn't have been happier!
