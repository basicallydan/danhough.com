            <p class="meta">Published 24 June 2012 in London, UK</p>
            <p class="intro">Hi, I'm Dan Hough, founder of <a href="http://www.streetscoutapp.com/">StreetScout</a> and developer at <a href="http://www.huddle.com/">Huddle</a>. I'm still pretty green in the tech world so this is a place for me to share my thoughts mostly on startups and web development. You can see all my blog posts <a href="/">here</a>. Thanks for reading!</p>
            <p>Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but I think there&#8217;s a time and a place for offering your business card. Seconds after meeting someone is not that time.</p>
            <p>I was at a <a href="http://startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">Startup Weekend</a> pitch training session: a chance to get your pitch critiqued by other potential founders, having a great conversation with a man eager to leave his 9-to-5 corporate job to go out on his own. We were discussing each others&#8217; ideas and coming up with some great stuff. Out of nowhere, a couple of guys turn up from a startup based in the same building. Let&#8217;s call them Clive and Percy.</p>
            <p>One of them, Clive, seems pretty nice, he tells us all about the company and asks us about why we&#8217;re there and what we hope to achieve. His company has been around for a few weeks and they&#8217;re really looking forward to launching their product. He then moves on to talk to some other people, so my new friend and I continue our conversation. But then Percy turns up and starts listening in on our conversation, so we introduce ourselves and tell him what we do.</p>
            <p>I see this interruption as a good opportunity to say my goodbyes, as I have other plans. I bid my conversation partner adieu and ask for his card so we can keep in touch (he had some great thoughts about my pitch &#8211; more about this in a later blog post). Just as I&#8217;m leaving though, Percy tells me to wait, pulls out
                <em>his</em>card and hands it to me.</p>
            <p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; say I, and I shake their hands and head off on my way.</p>
            <p>For all you Percys out there:
                <strong>Don&#8217;t feel obliged to give me your business card just because some other guy has.</strong>If we haven&#8217;t exchanged any meaningful words, learned anything about each other or shared any ideas, then it&#8217;s an empty gesture and it makes you seem arrogant.</p>
            <h3>What I would suggest</h3>
            <p>Spend some
                <strong>quality time</strong>with somebody else, find out what they could do for you and what you could do for them and
                <em>then</em>exchange cards. Who am I to you, Percy? Just some guy you found out the job title from, shook hands with and then saw go through the door marked &#8216;
                <span class="caps">EXIT</span>.&#8217;</p>
