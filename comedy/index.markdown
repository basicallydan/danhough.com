# Stand-up Comedy

I've been performing stand-up comedy since 2022, bringing my unique perspective as a British comedian born as an expat in Saudi Arabia to stages across London and Melbourne. My comedy blends personal storytelling with cultural observations, finding humor in everything from housemate dynamics to international identity.

## Achievements
